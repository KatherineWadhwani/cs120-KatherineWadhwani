        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p> Not-Uber is a ride-hailing service. Before deploying their app, Not-Uber's creators wanted to conduct a
            security and privacy assessment of their server (available at https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/). As a
            consultant, I pen-tested the system looking for vulnerabilities. My report is detailed below.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Methodology">
        <h1> Methodology </h1>
        <p> After observing both the client-side website as well as the source code server-vuln.js, I had a better
            understanding of how GET and POST requests were handled, as well as how the server interacted with the
            database. This immediately alerted me to several vulnerabilities, particularly those in which user input was
            not properly checked. From this, I constructed curl requests to target these vulnerabilities. I attempted to
            spot more vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP! While OWASP ZAP! was not as helpful as expected, it did alert me
            to the page's html which enabled me to further tailor my attacks.</p>

    <div id="Issues">
        <h1> Issues </h1>

        <p> <b> Issue 1: </b> Cross-Site Scripting</p>
        <p> <b> Location:</b> /rides path</p>
        <p> <b> Severity:</b> High Risk</p>
        <p> <b> Description:</b> I was able to inject javascript by setting username to code that exploited the DOM
            model. As seen in the image below, this code inserted a link (albeit a faulty link) to google. Specifically,
            it created a html document element, set it to google, and inserted the element at the top of the document.
            The code was nested between script tags to ensure that it was interpreted as javascript. Under no
            circumstances should a user be able to modify the website by directing users to another site.
        </p>
        <p> <b> Proof of Vulnerability:</b> </p>
        <img src="prob1.pdf" alt="Proof of Cross-Site Scripting">
        <p> <b> Resolution:</b> The username field should not allow the less-than character. Without this character,
            script tags would not be possible. </p>


        <p> <b> Issue 2: </b> SQL Injection</p>
        <p> <b> Location:</b> /update and /vehicles.json paths</p>
        <p> <b> Severity:</b> High Risk</p>
        <p> <b> Description:</b> Using the /update path, I was able to design a malicious value for username that
            deleted the vehicles table. By creating a value that contained a semicolon in the middle, the rest of the
            value was no longer interpreted as part of the username. This allowed me to execute the query "DROP
            vehicles;" which removed the entire table. As seen in the images below, the same get request was run using
            the /vehicles.json path. The first is before the table was deleted and the second is after. </p>
        <p> <b> Proof of Vulnerability:</b> </p>
        <img src="prob3.pdf" alt="Before SQL Injection Attack">
        <img src="prob2.pdf" alt="After SQL Injection Attack">
        <p> <b> Resolution:</b> The username field should not allow the semicolon character. I would suggest restricting
            username to alphanumeric characters and apostrophes. By limiting special characters in this way, SQL
            injection would not be possible. </p>



        <p> <b> Issue 3: </b> General Privacy</p>
        <p> <b> Location:</b>/rides and /vehicle.json paths</p>
        <p> <b> Severity:</b> Medium Risk</p>
        <p> <b> Description:</b> Using the /vehicle.json path, users can get data regarding rides that other passengers
            took. Most notably, this information contains passenger username. Username can then be passed into the
            /vehicle.json and /passenger.json paths to reveal sensitive information about other passengers. Users
            should never be able to access data regarding other passengers' trips. Trips include extremely sensitive
            information such as latitude/longitude which can be used to find passengers homes etc.</p>
        <p> <b> Proof of Vulnerability:</b> </p>
        <img src="prob3.pdf" alt="Proof of General Privacy Concerns">
        <p> <b> Resolution:</b> Only show passengers the rides in which they participated. If it is deemed necessary to
            show other rides, remove identifiable information such as username.</p>
    </div>



    <div id="Abstract of Findings">
        <h1> Abstract of Findings </h1>
        <p> My investigation revealed 3 major types of vulnerabilities. Users could input script that altered
            and
            redirected the webpage. Users could also delete records from the database. Finally, the site
            returned
            information
            that could be used to reveal sensitive user information.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Conclusion">
        <h1> Conclusion </h1>
        <p> While Not-Uber is an exciting and novel company, this investigation has found it to be a lawsuit
            waiting to happen. A dataleak is inevitable and the potential for insertion of malicious code via user input
            is endless. I strongly reccomend hiring skilled software engineers to "sanitize" user input, or validate
            that it is indeed the expected content and does not include potentially malicious characters. Additonally, I
            suggest limiting the information returned with the '/rides' path so as to preserve user privacy.
