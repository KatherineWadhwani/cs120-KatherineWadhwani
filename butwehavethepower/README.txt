Project by Katherine Wadhwani

Correctness and Troubleshooting;
To the best of my knowledge, all parts of this project have been implemented correctly. I noticed that
the lyrics provided to us don't include the commentary at the end of the video. Under these circumstances,
I chose to rely on the lyrics given and used "..." to acknowledge the other text.

Collaboration:
I did not discuss the project with anyone.

Hours to Complete:
I took about 4 hours to complete the lab.
