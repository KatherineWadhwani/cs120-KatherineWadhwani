Project by Katherine Wadhwani

Correctness and Troubleshooting:
To the best of my understanding, all parts of this project have been implemented correctly. I'm still struggling to implement the items in the "Going Beyond" section.

Collaboration:
I did not discuss the project with anyone, but I did use Ming's in-class example as starter code.

Hours to Complete:
I took about 5 hours to complete the lab.
