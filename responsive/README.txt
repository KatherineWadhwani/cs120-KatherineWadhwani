Project by Katherine Wadhwani

Correctness and Troubleshooting;
To the best of my understanding, all parts of this project have been implemented correctly (e.g. correct part of homer photo shows with corresponding screen width). The only issue I'm curious about is how height of the screen might
affect what's in view. However, I do not want to distort the image so I only considered width and did not manipulate height (allowing the ratio to remain constant.)

Collaboration:
I did not discuss the project with anyone.

Hours to Complete:
I took about 3 hours to complete the lab.
