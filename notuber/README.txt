Project by Katherine Wadhwani

Correctness and Troubleshooting;
This lab in particular was difficult to troubleshoot, as the car locations change. However, to the best of my understanding, all parts of this project
have been implemented correctly.

Collaboration:
I did not discuss the project with anyone.

Hours to Complete:
I took about 7 hours to complete the lab.
